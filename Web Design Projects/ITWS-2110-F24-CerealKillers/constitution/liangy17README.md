I did the history page by editing the css style and put the text content on the html. During the process, I found struggle to the improper html list element for the order of the content. For our <ul> being some kind of restrict, I used <dd>,<dl> and cause error (like child elements dont' exist)Then I fixed it by using only <br> to separate different paragraphs. 
I also did the annotations for Article 4, Amendment 13 - 18, and added them into the jsFunction file. When I adding them, I found that for long paragraphs, it is easy to get cover up with the last few lines, then I think I can use any <br> to add spaces of the bottom, which can fully display the whole content.
