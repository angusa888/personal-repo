I did all the css and edited the html to display the css styling. I got stuck for a bit when working on the dropdown Directory in the menu. Whenever I set the position of the ul element to be anything but fixed, the dropdown did not work. I spent some time trying to figure this out until I realized I wanted the ul to be fixed anyways for easy access to the directory. I also got a little stuck when editing the text of the constitution in the html file to fit within the div with class collumn. It turned out that there was a spare </div> in the document that I spent a long time searching for. I also did the analysis for Article 3, and Amendments 7-11.

I came up with the concept for our cite. I was inspired by https://genius.com/'s lyric annotations.
I used this color palette as a jumping off point for the colors in the css: https://coolors.co/palette/780000-c1121f-fdf0d5-003049-669bbc
