         <h2 class="header">The Articles of Confederation</h2>
         <p class="const-text">
            After the American Revolution, the Continental Congress, consisting of delegates from all 13 states, 
            drafted the Articles of Confederation. The aim was to create a country where each state had equal control over the central government. 
            Under the Articles of Confederation, each state had one vote, and unanimous agreement was required for any law to pass. 
            There was no standing army or unified system of commerce, and the only government body was Congress, 
            which lacked the power to tax its citizens. As a result, young America faced numerous domestic challenges and threats.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Pirates:</b> Pirates exploited the United States' lack of a standing army, leading to frequent theft of goods.
            <br>
            <b>Economic Strife:</b> Due to the lack of a unified currency and the government's inability to collect taxes, 
               America experienced rapid inflation and struggled to repay its debts to France, its ally during the war.
            <br>
            <b>Government Trouble:</b> unanimous agreement from all states proved problematic. When it came to passing laws, 
            just one state's rejection could block an entire bill or amendment. Rhode Island, despite its small population, 
            was particularly notorious for obstructing significant government changes.

            This came to a head with a series of violent uprisings known as Shays' Rebellion, which caused significant upheaval in Massachusetts. 
            The U.S. government was unable to respond effectively, resulting in 20 people being wounded and 2 dead.

            <b>The Continental Congress recognized the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation and decided to convene in Philadelphia to address and revise them.</b>

         <h2 class="header">The fixing of the Constitution</h2>
         <p class="const-text">
         The revision of the Constitution was a private affair, held in Independence Hall, the State House of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, 
         with the State House closed to the public. Delegates from the 13 states (except Rhode Island) met in secrecy to prevent outside influence on their discussions.

            Delegates Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay authored 85 essays—primarily written by Hamilton—to argue for the proposed Constitution and its provisions.
            <br>
            <b>Important Ideas:</b>
            <br>
            <b>Balancing Majority and Minority:</b> Constitution aimed to balance the power between majority and minority interests, ensuring that smaller states like Rhode Island could not unilaterally block government actions while still being fairly represented.
            <br>
            <b>Centralized Leadership: </b>The creation of a strong, energetic executive branch, which would later become the presidency, was essential for effective governance.
            <br>
            <b>Checks and Balances:</b> a system of checks and balances, including a judicial branch to oversee and scrutinize government decisions, a legislative branch that controls the budget and creates laws, and an executive branch that enforces the law and controls the standing army, was crucial to prevent abuses of power.
