I formatted the history.html page, wrote up and researched the history of the Constitution, and found pictures that are in the public domain for the history page. I also wrote up the analysis for Articles 2, 5,6, and 7, as well as Amendments 7-12. Additionally, I did the sources page. I found trouble formatting the images, as they were all originally different lengths and widths. I found a way to counteract this issue by adding spaces for different pictures. Additionally, I made sure the pages validated on W3C.
